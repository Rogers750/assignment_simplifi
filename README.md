In this assignment I tried to remake the design provided
I used 
-flex-box for positioning of the elements
-:: before and :: after for square corners 
-transform for rotation

In HTML
- made a parent element named parent for provind flex to childrens
- child element for box with borders
-html-css for grand children for HTML & CSS text
