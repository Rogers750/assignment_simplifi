# assignment_simplifi


In this assignment I tried to remake the design provided
I used 
-flex-box for positioning of the elements
-:: before and :: after for square corners 
-transform for rotation

In HTML
- made a parent element named parent for provind flex to childrens
- child element for box with borders
-html-css for grand children for HTML & CSS text




#algo

-in algo I was not clear weather to take those pair routes as input, since it was strictly written I hardcoded the initial paths
-I am taking string of the path, son taken and converting it to array of strings
-taking a initial point to start I am using hashmao to traverse to all the routes till I cover all of them
